 <p>
   - The best growth conditions for a mushroom depends on the species, but mushrooms 
    typically do best in cool, damp areas that are rich in available nutrients. locations where you might find wild mushroom growth include the base of trees,
    under pieces of wood, and gardens. Mushrooms can be further classified into types by growth patterns and preferred nutrients.</p>

   <h1> DO MUSHROOMS LIVE UNDERWATER?</h1>
<a>-There are some places you wouldn't think mushrooms would be found. When you ask, “Where are mushrooms found?,” the answer you least expect is underwater. To date, only about 3,000 species of aquatic fungi
 have been found. Until reported in the journal Mycologica in 2010, it was thought that there were no underwater mushrooms except for mushrooms growing on the occasional submerged piece of wood. 
 Psathyrella aquatica, discovered in Oregon, is the first gilled mushroom found to grow and flourish underwater.</a>
 <h1>IS MUSHROOM A FUNGI SIMILAR TO MILDEW?</h1>
 <p>-All mushrooms are fungi, but mushrooms are not like mildew or other types of fungi. Mushrooms belong in the kingdom Fungi, which boasts more than 144,000 known species and includes
     mold, yeasts, and rusts. Some mushrooms are edible and safe to eat, while others pose a great risk of harm if consumed or touched.
    Mushrooms are typically found near plants and may even use plants for stability as they grow.</p>

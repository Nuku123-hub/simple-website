    <h2><em>COMMON MUSHROOM CHARACTERISTICS</em></h2>
    <p><strong>A few of the most common mushrooms include</strong>:</p>
    <p> <strong> ● Stalk-and-cap appearance.</strong> The most recognizable, mushrooms with stalk and cap contain many edible varieties, such as the button mushroom and portobello mushrooms. Unfortunately, poisonous mushrooms, such as the Amanita bisporigera
       or “destroying angel,” also have a cap and stalk, making it difficult to discern edible mushrooms from their dangerous counterparts
       .</p>
       <p><strong>● Mycelium. </strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>● Spores</strong> All mushrooms produce spores, but the fate of the spores differentiates types of mushrooms from one another. Some mushroom spores are fertilized sexually, while other spores need to land nearby to produce a new mushroom</p>
<p>
  <strong>● Unique mushrooms</strong>
  Some mushrooms are simply unique in appearance and don't fit the mold of your typical button mushroom.

<p><strong>Antioxidants</strong>
  For people suffering from an injury or those with inflammation disorders, mushrooms are an important addition to the diet. Two powerful antioxidants, selenium and ergothioneine,
   are found in mushrooms and impart anti-inflammatory benefits when consumed.
</p>

<p><strong>Beta Glucan</strong>
  Found in the cell wall of mushrooms and other fungi, beta glucan is believed to enhance immune response, improve cholesterol, and support heart health. Mushrooms are a good source of beta glucan. Other sources include baker's yeast and whole-grain oats or barley. Researchers 
  continue to study beta glucan as its ability to prolong life in cancer patients is promising.
</p>

<p><strong>Phytochemicals</strong>
  A group of beneficial chemicals found in raw produce, phytochemicals have been shown to impart anti-aging and<em> anti-cancer benefits.</em> Some of the phytochemicals found in mushrooms include alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, and phenols. It is believed that these phytochemicals
   help the body ward off toxins, recover from illness, and alleviate pain.
</p>


<p><STROng>Vitamin D</STROng>
  Typically acquired via the skin's exposure to sunlight, vitamin D is rarely found in foods but is an absolute necessity for your bones. Foods containing vitamin D, such as fish or dairy products, may be restricted for those on a special diet. Mushrooms’ significant vitamin D 
  content augments your intake of vitamin D from the sun (without the need to wear SPF).
